# RPNCalc

A simple command line reverse polish notation calculator.

Supports both an interactive "repl" like mode, and a batch
mode taken argument.

## Usage
RPN -- starts interactive calc mode: press enter after every value/operator

RPN CALCULATION -- runs the CALCULATION and prints the result non interactively

## TODO
 * add support for entering more than one value per line in interactive mode
 * variables
 * more math functions: sin, sqrt, etc.
